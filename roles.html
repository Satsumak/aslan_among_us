        <p>
          The primary goal of a Crewmate is to complete all tasks while not
          being killed by the Impostor, with the secondary goal being Finding
          the Impostor, and kicking them off the ship. Crewmates who have been
          killed by an Impostor become ghosts. The Crewmates are assigned a
          variety of tasks, ranging from fixing color-coded wiring, uploading
          data to the admin, refueling ship engines, memorizing patterns, as
          well as many more tasks not listed here.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          A Crewmate can use the report button to report a dead body, and bring
          the entire crew into a meeting to discuss who the Impostor may be.
          Impostors also have this ability.
        </p>
        <h6>USE</h6>
        <p>
          A Crewmate can use the 'Use' button for a variety of interactions. The
          most common is for activating and completing tasks. Crewmates can also
          use this button to manually call an emergency meeting (if the host
          allows for it), check security cameras, check doorlogs, or to view the
          admin map. Impostors also have this button, but cannot complete tasks
          with it.
        </p>
        <h5>DEATH</h5>

          <p>Dead character in ghost form</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          When a crew member is killed by the Impostor, their body is dropped to
          the ground, completely broken in half with a bone sticking out, and a
          ghost will appear from the body. In this state a Crewmate can move
          freely through the walls, without having to cross an entire corridor
          to reach the place and can do tasks, however, the only disadvantages
          are that their messages in the chats do not appear to the remaining
          survivors, they cannot start an emergency meeting, or resolve
          sabotages. Ghosts can also use the chat feature outside of meetings to
          chat with other ghosts. The corpse of a Crewmate disappears after it
          is reported, as well as if someone reports another body or an
          emergency meeting is called. If the Crewmate has a pet, it will stay
          on the spot they have died. This can prove to be decisive evidence to
          convict the Impostor posing as a Crewmate, if used wisely.

        <h4>IMPOSTOR</h4>
        <h5>GOALS</h5>
        <p>
          The primary goal of the Impostor is to kill enough Crewmates to have
          an equal amount of impostor(s) and crewmates before all tasks are
          completed, and to have their true identity remain hidden.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Impostor cannot complete any tasks, however, they are given a task
          list as general guidance on how to feign the appearance of a Crewmate.
          Impostors have the ability to perform various acts of sabotage in
          order to force Crewmates into unfortunate scenarios.
        </p>
        <div id="wrap">
          <img

        </div>
        <p>
          Depending on game settings, there can be up to three Impostors in a
          game. The chance of a player being an Impostor is 100 multiplied by
          the number of impostors divided by the number of players, for example:
          in a one-Impostor lobby of 2, each player has a 50% chance of being an
          Impostor, whereas on a lobby of 4, each player has a 25% chance, and
          in a lobby of 10, each player has a 10% chance, etc. This chance does
          not change regardless of your record as an Impostor or Crewmate; it is
          consistently random between all members of the lobby.
        </p>
        <h5>EJECTIONS</h5>
        <div id="wrap">
          <img
            src="https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/4b1ceee5-9458-4434-80bc-fc5d83a2ea88/de5c4vq-5c896932-f282-4102-93f7-e4310ae15bd5.png/v1/fill/w_1192,h_670,q_70,strp/among_us_ejection__1__by_unitedworldmedia_de5c4vq-pre.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOiIsImlzcyI6InVybjphcHA6Iiwib2JqIjpbW3siaGVpZ2h0IjoiPD03MjAiLCJwYXRoIjoiXC9mXC80YjFjZWVlNS05NDU4LTQ0MzQtODBiYy1mYzVkODNhMmVhODhcL2RlNWM0dnEtNWM4OTY5MzItZjI4Mi00MTAyLTkzZjctZTQzMTBhZTE1YmQ1LnBuZyIsIndpZHRoIjoiPD0xMjgwIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmltYWdlLm9wZXJhdGlvbnMiXX0.wEwU-vUjVUnPqL8n4_4FxfIGF3wdx3wmqA7P_LwVCvo"

          />
          <p>Impostor being ejected</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Impostors, if discovered, will be ejected off the map and killed in
          the process. This is depicted through various scenes depending on the
          current map: if playing on The Skeld, the Impostor is ejected off the
          airlock and into space, on MIRA HQ they are pushed off the station to
          fall to their death, and on Polus, they are thrown into a lava pool. A
          difference between the Crewmate ejection animation and the Imposter
          ejection animation is the imposter will have a thumbs up when falling
          in the lava, while a crewmate will stick their hand out, like reaching
          for help. The Imposter giving a thumbs up may be a reference to
          Terminator 2. If there are still other Impostors left after one is
          ejected, that Impostor will become a ghost like the crew would.
          However if no Impostors remain alive, the crew wins immediately. As a
          ghost, Impostors can continue to sabotage the map to help their fellow
          Impostors win.
        </p>
        <h5>ABILITES</h5>
        <h6>KILL</h6>
        <p>
          An Impostor has the ability to kill a Crewmate. Killing a Crewmate
          turns them into a ghost, and leaves a dead body in the spot they were
          killed at. Kills have a cooldown of 10-60 seconds, and a kill distance
          of either Short, Normal, and Long, depending on game settings.
        </p>
        <div id="wrap">
          <img
            src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/among-us-wiki/images/5/5a/DeadCharacter.png/revision/latest?cb=20200803160829"
            alt="Dead body of crewmate character"
            width="150px;"
          />
          <p>Body of crewmate after being killed</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In the view of the Impostor, when killing someone, the player's body
          is broken in half, where after a few seconds, they fall to the ground,
          exposing their bone, however, blood does not appear in the animation.
          In the Crewmate victim's view, while his body falls to the ground, an
          animation is shown, which can appear in different ways, either the
          crew member is shot, stabbed, impaled, or had their neck snapped.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kill cooldown comes to a halt/stops if you are accessing tools or
          fixing crises, such as being inside a vent, looking through security
          cameras, accessing the admin map, looking through logs or fixing
          oxygen/lights/reactor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kill cooldown is shortened to 10 seconds on the first round before
          any meetings, and will be set to the normal cooldown time after a body
          has been reported or an emergency meeting is called.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kill ability also forces the Imposter to move instantaneously to
          the location of the Crewmate, essentially teleporting there leaving a
          faint trail of their presence in their previous location.
        </p>
        <h6>SABOTAGE</h6>
        <div id="wrap">
          <img
            src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/smt64-and-friends/images/0/06/A3829731-486D-4569-9C3E-E3B6149ED7B3.png/revision/latest?cb=20200909221927"

          />
          <p>Sabotage button for impostors</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          An Impostor has the ability to Sabotage, which compromises an aspect
          of the map's machinery, creating a temporary problem that Crewmates
          must either wait out, ignore, or fix. Previously, Impostors could not
          solve sabotage, which made discovering them easier, but nowadays they
          are able to; allowing an Impostor to fix their own sabotage to avoid
          suspicion. Sabotage can also be done as a ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sabotage cooldown comes to a halt/stops if you are accessing
          tasks/tools such as being inside a vent, looking through security
          cameras, accessing the admin map, looking through logs, or fixing
          oxygen/lights/reactor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reactor meltdown and O2 shutdown are events that, if not fixed,
          will result in a win for the Impostor. Sabotaging lights or
          communications will not result in a win, but will make it harder for
          crewmates to do their tasks until fixed by compromising their vision
          or task list respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          The communications sabotage will make finding their tasks much harder,
          forcing them to fix communications; however, it can be ignored. A
          communications sabotage will also disable functions such as Admin,
          Doorlog, Vitals, and Security Cameras for all players, regardless of
          whether they are an impostor or crewmate.
        </p>
        <div id="wrap">
          <img
            src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/among-us-wiki/images/2/2a/SabotageMapTheSkeld.png/revision/latest?cb=20200803202232"
            alt="Map view of sabotage options"
            width="500px;"
          />
          <p>Sabotaging map</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The lights sabotage will lower the crewmates' vision, it often plays
          with their eyes and makes them suspect one another when a nearby
          crewmate is killed. This can be ignored; however it is not recommended
          due to the higher chance of not finding the dead body of crewmates,
          and not being able to see nearby players who are potential Impostors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Impostor can Sabotage doors, which closes them for 10 seconds.
          This Sabotage has a 17-second cooldown, which begins when the door is
          initially sabotaged; meaning that after the door opens, the Impostor
          will have to wait 7 seconds before closing it again. Sabotage cannot
          be accessed beside vents.
        </p>
        <p>
          All sabotage cooldowns are shared between all Impostors, so if you
          sabotage something you may hamper your teammate. All sabotage
          cooldowns besides doors are the same, so by sabotaging one thing you
          activate a cooldown for all other sabotages, except for the doors.
        </p>
        <h6>VENT</h6>
        <div id="wrap">
          <img
            src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/among-us-wiki/images/d/db/Vent.png/revision/latest?cb=20200915213612"
            alt="Visual of vent button for impostors"
            width="175px;"
          />
          <p>Vent button for impostors</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The Impostor can hide in vents. Vents allow the Impostor to either
          hide or quickly move around the map. When close enough to a vent, the
          Sabotage button will be replaced with the vent button. However, hiding
          in the vent stops your kill cooldown and sabotage cooldown until you
          exit the vent.
        </p>
        <h6>REPORT</h6>
        <p>
          Like the crew, Impostors can use this ability to report dead bodies
          anywhere. This is also a form of disguise whose purpose is to avoid
          suspicion. When reporting, this opens up the moment of discussion
          about who the Impostor is
        </p>
        <h6>USE</h6>
        <p>
          Impostors also have this ability that allows them to interact with
          other objects, the only ones being the emergency button, the
          administration map, security cameras, sensors, and the vitality
          machine. This is not true for people playing on mobile.
