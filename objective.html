      <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
      <p>
        The premise of Among Us is quite simple: you are one of 4 to 10 players
        on a space ship. One of these is an Impostor whose main goal is to kill
        everyone else. The remainder of the players are part of the regular crew
        who are just trying to survive and complete their tasks. To do this,
        they have to complete a number of individual tasks or find the Impostor
        and vote them out Survivor-style. If they are successful, the Crew wins.
        If the Impostor manages to kill them all, he or she wins.
      </p>

        Everyone spawns in the around a table and, depending on the host's
        settings, as well as RNG, crew-mates have to visit some or most of the
        other rooms to complete their tasks. While Impostors do not have tasks
        as their specific objectives, they can fake “completing” certain
        activities as a way to gain everyone else's trust. Every user has a
        chance to call an emergency meeting or, upon seeing a dead body, to
        report it to everyone else. For the mobile release, discussions are only
        possible during these time-limited events.

        If you are an Impostor, your main goal is to convince others that you
        did not do it, while the Crew has to spot you out. Since it is a voting
        system where the person with the most votes gets eliminated from the
        game, it does not really matter who does what. Instead, your
        argumentative powers are what makes a difference. To sway people in one
        direction or another, you have to be prepared to make your case as
        convincingly as possible. There is a short time-limit, so you either
        have to present very strong evidence or come up with a believable
        narrative that will take others off your trail.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are killed by the Impostor, you become a ghost. Although you
        cannot interact or discuss with others, you can still help them complete
        tasks. They will not be able to see you, though. And if you become a
        ghost when you're an Impostor out of 2 or 3, you can still sabotage,
        which is quite handy because no-one can see you.
