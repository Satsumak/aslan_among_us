      <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
      <p>
        Among Us is an online sci-fi murder-mystery game by Innersloth, and was
        released on June 15, 2018, on iOS, Android, and Steam on August 18,
        2018. The game is set in a spaceship, which contains a group of crew
        members where there is, among them, an impostor who wants to sabotage
        the ship and kill everyone, where they must do the tasks and find out
        who the impostor is.

        Among Us is set in The Skeld, which is the main map of the game set in a
        spaceship. Starting in 2019, two new maps were launched: Mira HQ, which
        is set on a space base, on August 8, 2019, and Polus, which is set on a
        planet, on November 12, 2019. Starting in 2020, was considered by
        Innersloth a complete game, and as of June 11, 2020, the two new maps,
        which were previously paid for, were released, both for mobile and PC,
        for free for players to host. Among Us 2, according to the company, was
        scheduled to be available by 2021, but is now cancelled and work will
        proceed on improving the original game instead. In addition, many
        merchandises, such as T-shirts, toys, have been announced and launched.

        The game takes place on a space ship in outer space. There are two
        teams: the Impostors and the Crewmates. There can be a total of 10
        players in an online game, with up to three impostors. The Impostors'
        objective is to eliminate all Crewmates using either aggressive,
        defensive, or passive tactics before the Crewmates complete all of their
        tasks or discover their true identity. The Crewmates' objective is to
        complete all of their tasks while figuring out who the Impostor is.
